[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f2fd9c3d-9b88-4918-813e-2e8321d6549c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/agitated-lichterman-469cf3/deploys)

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
